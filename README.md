Since the 1960s, it is estimated that between 7 and 10 million people in the United States insist on jogging, with the aim of improving health, strengthening physical fitness, losing weight and preventing obesity, and seeking a beautiful body and a comfortable mood. Jogging consumes 10 to 13 calories per minute (playing tennis costs 7 to 9 calories per minute). In 1967, the University of Oregon's track coach, Bowman, and the heart-shaped medical scientist Harris, published the book "Jogging", which greatly promoted the popularity of jogging activities.


Choose a flat road, do not wear shoes or plastic shoes, if you are on asphalt or cement, it is best to wear thick-soled shoes. You should take a walk before running, do deep breathing, and move your joints. If you are on the road, you should pay attention to safety and try to choose the sidewalk. If you feel loss of appetite, fatigue, and dizziness after jogging, it may be that the amount of exercise is too large, you must adjust it, or get the doctor's guidance.
